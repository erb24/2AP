Force field has been modified from the original version to include the 2-aminopurine (AP5, 2AP, AP3) modified
nucleobase in the force field.

The N1 - C2 - N3 angular and dihedral interactions were taken from the analogous guanine parameterization, following the procedure 
used by Lankas et al. (Biophys J. 2002 May; 82(5): 2592â€“2609), and the missing angular and dihedral interactions for the H6 atom attached to C6
in the purine ring were found using the GAFF in the antechamber program in AmberTools20.
